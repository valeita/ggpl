    "\n",
    "The following project has the aim to build a complete house, using the previous workshops. Each of them in fact carries a piece of the house, the stairs, the floor, the roof, the pillars and the beams of the house itself. The house will be built with a roof top terrace, external stairs from where you can access to your home. The project is parametric, and is not just to build a house, but also a building with multiple floors and flats per floor."
