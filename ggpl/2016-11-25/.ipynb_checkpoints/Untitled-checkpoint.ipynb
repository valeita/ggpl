    "The workshop of today rapresent a generator of doors / windows.\n",
    "taken as input the list of values Representing A length, compared to the axis of x, y and z, A three-dimensional array of elements 0 and 1 (I also added the element -1, in order to be able of Building with glass doors / windows if desired), and other 3 parameters dx, dy, dz, which are the inputs of the sub-function of the main function, it will run an algorithm that processes the data and builds the structure. Please note that the main function is a two-level function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, two sample inputs were taken created. One relating to a window, very simple and concocted. One instead took a long time for its design, both for the size that they had to be as realistic as possible, both for the three-dimensional matrix, which is the result of well 308 Boolean array, written one by one.\n"

    "the main function:\n",
    "It takes as input a total of 4 + 3 parameters, as already mentioned in the description. the first 3 are the lists of values along the x, y and z. the fourth parameter is a Boolean three-dimensional matrix.\n",
    "the value 1 will be inserted in the vicinity of a cell that is full, the value zero in the vicinity of an empty cell instead.\n",
    "A change I have brought to the program compared to what was required me, is to put in the also the element -1 matrix. It therefore no longer only Boolean, but allows me to handle this problem. For the creation of a glass door, I had to find a way to manage a zero possible that it was neither an empty cell, nor a full cell (I mean a part in wood for example), but it was a cell where he was going glass inserted.\n",
    "Beyond this, if the input is inserted a three-dimensional Boolean array, the program still responds well, just insert a blank space instead of glass. In doing so, I have not violated the requirements of the project.\n",
    "The last 3 parameters dx, dy and dz are the values that are used to perform a check on the created structure, and must be of the right size to handle the problem that the wood humidity can increase with the size of for example. They are not mere scale values."

It is done so a comparison between the size of the object created, and size took more constant alpha input that I took as 3 cm(1,5 cm on the left and on the right). The constant will be the minimum dimensions of free space in addition to the size of the object to accept its implementation, and manage any future problems due to the material.\n",
